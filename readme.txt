This game is called Screenshaver and your task is to shave the screen with the razor. Each round, you have 45 seconds to shave randomly placed hairs on the screen by hovering your mouse. The player gets a point for each hair shaved, and a shaving sound effect plays. The background music is John Cage's 4 minutes and 33 seconds because I couldn't decide on game music. Once you shave all the hairs or the time runs out, you continue to the next round. If you don't manage to get all the hairs, you lose a life (displayed on screen), and the new hairs from the next round grow on top of the ones you missed. Additionally, the razor and its rect get smaller as the game progresses, making it harder to shave all the hairs. After three lives, the game ends and you go to the exit screen, where you can restart the game. My idea for this assignment doesn't really require input validation and error recovery. The game will not break if you click the screen or type something while playing.
